Proximity hierarchy
=================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.ProximityMonitor
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the interface. See the
			properties section for available properties.

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed a read-write are changeable.
			On success this will emit a PropertyChanged signal.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments

Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of a given
			property.

Properties
		uint8 PathLoss[readonly]

			If Tx Power Service is available, this property value
			will be reported on regular intervals when the peer is
			connected. Range: 0 - 100. The number is a relative
			value to represent inaccurately the signal strength,
			where 0 represents out of range and 100 close to the
			reporter.

		string Threshold [readwrite]

			Persistent property. Trigger for immediate alert.
			Values: "low", "medium", "high". Enabled only if Tx
			Power and Immediate Alert services are available in
			the reporter. Controls when the immediate alert is
			triggered in the reporter.

		boolean ThresholdAlert[readonly]

			Alert indicating that threshold has been reached or the
			path loss returned to a value below the threshold. It is
			up to the implementation catch this property value and
			emit a sound in the proximity monitor.

		string LinkLossAlertLevel [readwrite]

			Persistent property. Sets the alert level in the
			proximity reporter for link loss scenario. Values:
			"none", "mild", "high".

		string PathLossAlertLevel [readwrite]

			Persistent property. Alert level for path loss scenario.
			It's a LOCAL property value written in the Alert Level of
			the Immediate Alert service when the threshold alert is
			triggered. Values: "none", "mild", "high".

		string FindMeAlertLevel [readwrite]

			Alert level to be written in the Find Me Target.
			Values: "none", "mild", "high". Default value is
			"none". Applications can disable the alert setting
			the value to "none". If the "Target" is not found,
			"none" will be emitted after the configured timeout.
			When changing the level, signal is the confirmation
			that the value was written in the remote.
