Interface	org.bluez.obex.AgentManager1
Object path	/org/bluez/obex

Methods		void RegisterAgent(object agent)

			Register an agent to request authorization of
			the user to accept/reject objects. Object push
			service needs to authorize each received object.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.obex.Error.AlreadyExists

		void UnregisterAgent(object agent)

			This unregisters the agent that has been previously
			registered. The object path parameter must match the
			same value that has been used on registration.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.obex.Error.DoesNotExist

Methods		object CreateSession(string destination, dict args)

			Create a new OBEX session for the given remote address.

			The last parameter is a dictionary to hold optional or
			type-specific parameters. Typical parameters that can
			be set in this dictionary include the following:

				string "Target" : type of session to be created
				string "Source" : local address to be used
				byte "Channel"
