BlueZ D-Bus Adapter API description
***********************************


Adapter hierarchy
=================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Adapter1
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		void StartDiscovery()

			This method starts the device discovery session. This
			includes an inquiry procedure and remote device name
			resolving. Use StopDiscovery to release the sessions
			acquired.

			This process will start creating Device objects as
			new devices are discovered.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.NotReady
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void StopDiscovery()

			This method will cancel any previous StartDiscovery
			transaction.

			Note that a discovery procedure is shared between all
			discovery sessions thus calling StopDiscovery will only
			release a single session.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.NotReady
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed
					 org.bluez.Error.NotAuthorized

		void RemoveDevice(object device)

			This removes the remote device object at the given
			path. It will remove also the pairing information.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

Properties	string Address [readonly]

			The Bluetooth device address.

		string Name [readwrite]

			The Bluetooth friendly name. This value can be
			changed and a PropertyChanged signal will be emitted.

			This property might be controlled by an external
			daemon (for example hostnamed) and then every write
			attempt will fail.

			On a well configured system this property will be
			automatically set to the pretty hostname.

		uint32 Class [readonly]

			The Bluetooth class of device.

		boolean Powered [readwrite]

			Switch an adapter on or off. This will also set the
			appropriate connectable state of the controller.

		boolean Discoverable [readwrite]

			Switch an adapter to discoverable or non-discoverable
			to either make it visible or hide it. This is a global
			setting and should only be used by the settings
			application.

			If the DiscoverableTimeout is set to a non-zero
			value then the system will set this value back to
			false after the timer expired.

			In case the adapter is switched off, setting this
			value will fail.

			When changing the Powered property the new state of
			this property will be updated via a PropertyChanged
			signal.

			For any new adapter this settings defaults to false.

		boolean Pairable [readwrite]

			Switch an adapter to pairable or non-pairable. This is
			a global setting and should only be used by the
			settings application.

			Note that this property only affects incoming pairing
			requests.

			For any new adapter this settings defaults to true.

		uint32 PairableTimeout [readwrite]

			The pairable timeout in seconds. A value of zero
			means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in
			pairable mode forever.

			The default value for pairable timeout should be
			disabled (value 0).

		uint32 DiscoverableTimeout [readwrite]

			The discoverable timeout in seconds. A value of zero
			means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay in
			discoverable/limited mode forever.

			The default value for the discoverable timeout should
			be 180 seconds (3 minutes).

		boolean Discovering [readonly]

			Indicates that a device discovery procedure is active.

		array{string} UUIDs [readonly]

			List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available
			local services.
