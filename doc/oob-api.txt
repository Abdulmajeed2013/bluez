Currently only Secure Simple Pairing is supported. This might change when white
paper describing OOB pairing for Bluetooth Low Energy will become available.

Out Of Band hierarchy
=====================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.OutOfBand
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		dict ReadLocalData()

			This method reads local OOB data from adapter. Return
			value is a dictionary. Following keys are possible:

			array{byte} Hash:

					16 bytes hash blob.

			array{byte} Randomizer:

					16 bytes randomizer blob.

			Other data that can be transmitted via OOB mechanism
			can be obtained from org.bluez.Adapter1 interface.

			Note: This method will generate and return new data
			every time it is called. Data received in previous
			calls is invalidated and cannot be used for pairing.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
					 org.bluez.Error.InProgress
					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported

		object AddRemoteData(string address, dict data)

			This method adds new Out Of Band data for
			specified address. If data for specified address
			already exists it will be overwritten with new one.
			If device object with given address does not exist yet
			it will be created.

			Returns the object path of device for given address.

			All data is optional.

			possible keys:

				array{byte} Hash:

					16 bytes hash blob, it is used as is
					so the size and byte order must match.

				array{byte} Randomizer:

					16 bytes randomizer blob, it is used as
					is so the size and byte order must
					match. If Randomizer is provided Hash
					also needs to be provided.

				uint32 Class:

					The Bluetooth class of device of the
					remote device.

				string Name:

					Remote device name.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
					 org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported

		void RemoveRemoteData(string address)

			This method removes Out Of Band data for specified
			address. If data for specified address does not exist
			nothing is removed.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Failed
					 org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.NotSupported
