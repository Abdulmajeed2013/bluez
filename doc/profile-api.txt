Copyright (C) 2012  Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.


Profile hierarchy
=================

Service		unique name
Interface	org.bluez.Profile
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release()

			This method gets called when the service daemon
			unregisters the profile. A profile can use it to do
			cleanup tasks. There is no need to unregister the
			profile, because when this method gets called it has
			already been unregistered.

		void NewConnection(object device, fd)

			This method gets called when a new service level
			connection has been made and authorized.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void RequestDisconnection(object device)

			This method gets called when a profile gets
			disconnected.

			The file descriptor is no longer owned by the service
			daemon and the profile implementation needs to take
			care of cleaning up all connections.

			If multiple file descriptors are indicated via
			NewConnection, it is expected that all of them
			are disconnected before returning from this
			method call.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.Rejected
			                 org.bluez.Error.Canceled

		void Cancel()

			This method gets called to indicate that the profile
			request failed before a reply was returned.

			All request are queued and there will be only one
			pending pequest at a time per profile.
