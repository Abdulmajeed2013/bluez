Cycling Speed and Cadence Manager hierarchy
===========================================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.CyclingSpeedManager
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		RegisterWatcher(object agent)

			Registers a watcher to monitor cycling speed and
			cadence measurements.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments

		UnregisterWatcher(object agent)

			Unregisters a watcher.

Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile hierarchy
===========================================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.CyclingSpeed
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

Methods		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			read-write properties can be changed. On success
			this will emit a PropertyChanged signal.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments

		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the interface. See the
			Properties section for the available properties.

		SetCumulativeWheelRevolutions(uint32 value)

			Sets cumulative wheel revolutions value if
			Cumulative Wheel Revolutions feature is supported.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.NotSupported

Signals		PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string Location (optional) [readwrite]

			Current sensor location, if supported.
			If Multiple Sensor Locations feature is supported,
			this property can be set to one of values read from
			SupportedLocations property.

			Possible values: "other", "top-of-shoe", "in-shoe",
					"hip", "front-wheel", "left-crank",
					"right-crank", "left-pedal",
					"right-pedal", "front-hub",
					"rear-dropout", "chainstay",
					"rear-wheel", "rear-hub"

		array{string} SupportedLocations (optional) [readonly]

			List of locations supported by sensor, only present
			if Multiple Sensor Locations feature is supported.

		boolean WheelRevolutionDataSupported [readonly]

			true if sensor can read and set Cumulative Wheel
			Revolutions value, false otherwise.

		boolean MultipleSensorLocationsSupported [readonly]

			true if sensor supports Multiple Sensor Locations
			feature and can set Location, false otherwise.

Cycling Speed and Cadence Watcher hierarchy
===========================================

Service		unique name
Interface	org.bluez.CyclingSpeedWatcher
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void MeasurementReceived(object device, dict measurement)

			This callback is called whenever wheel and/or crank
			revolutions measurement is received from sensor.

			Measurement:

				uint32 WheelRevolutions (optional):

					Cumulative number of wheel revolutions.

				uint16 LastWheelEventTime (optional):

					Time of last event from wheel sensor.
					Value is expressed in 1/1024 second
					units and can roll over during a ride.

				uint16 CrankRevolutions (optional):

					Cumulative number of crank revolutions.
					This value can occasionally roll over.

				uint16 LastCrankEventTime (optional):

					Time of last event from crank sensor.
					Value is expressed in 1/1024 second
					units and can roll over during a ride.
