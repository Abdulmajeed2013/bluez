Manager hierarchy
=================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Manager
Object path	/

		object DefaultAdapter()

			Returns object path for the default adapter.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.NoSuchAdapter

		object FindAdapter(string pattern)

			Returns object path for the specified adapter. Valid
			patterns are "hci0" or "00:11:22:33:44:55".

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.NoSuchAdapter

		void RegisterProfile(object profile, string uuid, dict options)

			This registers a profile implementation.

			If an application disconnects from the bus all
			its registered profiles will be removed.

			HFP HS UUID: 0000111e-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb

				Default RFCOMM channel is 6. And this requires
				authentication.

			Available options:

				string Name

					Human readable name for the profile

				string Role

					For asymmetric profiles that do not
					have UUIDs available to uniquely
					identify each side this
					parameter allows specifying the
					precise local role.

					Possible values: "client", "server"

				uint16 Channel

					RFCOMM channel number that is used
					for client and server UUIDs.

					If applicable it will be used in the
					SDP record as well.

				uint16 PSM

					PSM number that is used for client
					and server UUIDs.

					If applicable it will be used in the
					SDP record as well.

				boolean RequireAuthentication

					Pairing is required before connections
					will be established. No devices will
					be connected if not paired.

				boolean RequireAuthorization

					Request authorization before any
					connection will be established.

				boolean AutoConnect

					In case of a client UUID this will
					force connection of the RFCOMM or
					L2CAP channels when a remote device
					is connected.

				string ServiceRecord

					Provide a manual SDP record.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
			                 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists

		void UnregisterProfile(object profile)

			This unregisters the profile that has been previously
			registered. The object path parameter must match the
			same value that has been used on registration.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist

Signals		AdapterAdded(object adapter)

			Parameter is object path of added adapter.

		AdapterRemoved(object adapter)

			Parameter is object path of removed adapter.

		DefaultAdapterChanged(object adapter)

			Parameter is object path of the new default adapter.

			In case all adapters are removed this signal will not
			be emitted. The AdapterRemoved signal has to be used
			to detect that no default adapter is selected or
			available anymore.

Properties	array{object} Adapters [readonly]

			List of adapter object paths.
