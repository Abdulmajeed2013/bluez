.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B
hcidump
reads raw HCI data coming from and going to a Bluetooth device (which can be
specified with the option
.BR -i ,
default is the first available one) and prints to screen commands, events and
data in a human-readable form. Optionally, the dump can be written to a file
rather than parsed, and the dump file can be parsed in a subsequent moment.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI -h

.TP
.BI -i " <hciX>"
Data is read from
.IR hciX ,
which must be the name of an installed Bluetooth device. If not specified,
and if
.B
-r
option is not set, data is read from the first available Bluetooth device.
.TP
.BI -s " <len>" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-snap-len=" "<len>"
Sets max length of processed packets to
.IR len .
.TP
.BI -p " <psm>" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-psm=" "<psm>"

.TP
.BI -w " <file>" "\fR,\fP \-\^\-save-dump=" "<file>"
